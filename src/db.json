However, I have now realised that the entire application looks a tiny bit wonky. \"Wonky?\", you may ask. I will answer with \"yes, wonky.\" The problem that I realised is that the entire UI is running on the root div instead of the body div and when I tried to implement the class system for dark mode, I accidentally miscalculated the fact that I tried to put the entire thing in one div and change the class of that div. While that is not a completely shambolic idea, it also poses a risk that the viewport at the bottom will be abruptly cut which is what is happening right now.\n\nSo what will I try and do?\n\nI will fix the problem by actually putting the posts inside a div. Not only will that make it look cleaner but I can also then fit the entire React Component it all in one page in my portfolio site."
